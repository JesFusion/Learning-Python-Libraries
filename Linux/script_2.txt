echo $SHELL - Tekls you what shell you're using


whoami - prints out your username

# i. WHAT: Prints the network name of the machine.
# ii. WHY: Crucial when managing multiple servers so you don't accidentally reboot the wrong one.
hostname

# 3. EXPLORE THE HIERARCHY
# i. WHAT: Change directory to the Root (The very bottom of the tree).
# ii. WHY: To leave your home folder and see the system structure.
cd /

# i. WHAT: List files to confirm the FHS folders exist.
# ii. WHY: You should see 'bin', 'etc', 'home', 'usr' here.
ls

# i. WHAT: Change directory into the configuration folder.
# ii. WHY: To prove that 'etc' is where config files live.
cd /etc

# i. WHAT: Change directory BACK to your personal workspace (Home).
# ii. WHY: ~ is the safest place to be. We always return here after exploring.
cd ~




















































# 1. ESTABLISH BASELINE
# i. WHAT: Print Working Directory.
# ii. WHY: Confirming we start at Home (Expected: /home/jesse).
pwd

# 2. CREATE A DUMMY PROJECT STRUCTURE
# i. WHAT: Create a nested folder structure 'projects/mlops_v1'.
# ii. WHY: To give us a "deep" directory to practice jumping into.
# iii. CHANGE IT?: Changing names changes the path, but logic remains.
mkdir -p projects/mlops_v1

# 3. THE DEEP DIVE
# i. WHAT: Change directory into the newly created folder.
# ii. WHY: Entering our workspace.
cd projects/mlops_v1

# i. WHAT: Verify location.
# ii. WHY: Should output /home/jesse/projects/mlops_v1.
pwd

# 4. THE SYSTEM JUMP (Simulating checking logs)
# i. WHAT: Teleport immediately to the system log directory.
# ii. WHY: In production, you often need to check /var/log while working on code.
cd /var/log

# i. WHAT: List files in 'human-readable' format.
# ii. WHY: To check if log files are huge (GBs) or empty (KBs) without doing math.
ls -lh

# 5. THE RETURN (The Efficiency Hack)
# i. WHAT: Change Directory "Minus" (Previous).
# ii. WHY: Instantly snaps you back to /home/jesse/projects/mlops_v1 without typing it again.
# iii. IMPACT: Saves 10-20 seconds of typing. Crucial during emergencies.
cd -

# 6. VERIFY HIDDEN ASSETS
# i. WHAT: Go to Home.
# ii. WHY: Resetting position.
cd ~

# i. WHAT: List All files including hidden ones.
# ii. WHY: To see .bashrc or .profile which are usually invisible.
ls -a

















































# 1. SETUP: CREATE A DEEP STRUCTURE
# i. WHAT: Create nested directories 'simulation/production/logs' inside Home.
# ii. WHY: To create a scenario where "Absolute" vs "Relative" navigation feels different.
# iii. WHAT IF: We change it? We just change the folder names, logic stays the same.
mkdir -p ~/simulation/production/logs

# 2. THE ABSOLUTE PATH APPROACH
# i. WHAT: Change directory starting from Root (/) all the way to logs.
# ii. WHY: This is the "Safe" way. It works no matter where you currently are in the system.
# iii. MLOps CONTEXT: This is how you would write the path in a Cron job script.
cd /home/$(whoami)/simulation/production/logs

# i. WHAT: Print where we are.
# ii. WHY: Confirm we arrived.
pwd

# 3. THE RELATIVE PATH APPROACH
# i. WHAT: Go up two levels (back to 'simulation').
# ii. WHY: We are navigating relative to our current position in 'logs'.
cd ../..

# i. WHAT: Verify we are now in 'simulation'.
# ii. WHY: '..' took us to 'production', the second '..' took us to 'simulation'.
pwd

# 4. TAB COMPLETION DRILL
# i. WHAT: Go back into production/logs using Tab.
# ii. WHY: Type 'cd p' -> [TAB] -> 'cd o' -> [TAB].
# iii. BENEFIT: Prevents typos. If Tab doesn't work, you made a typo or the file doesn't exist.
cd production/logs

















































# 1. THE QUICK CHECK
# i. WHAT: Ask what the 'cat' command is.
# ii. WHY: I heard someone say "cat the file" and I don't know what that means.
whatis cat

# 2. THE CHEAT SHEET
# i. WHAT: Ask 'ls' (list) for its help summary.
# ii. WHY: I forgot the flag to show hidden files and I don't want to open the full manual.
ls --help

# 3. THE DEEP DIVE (Interactive)
# i. WHAT: Open the full manual for the 'rm' (remove) command.
# ii. WHY: I need to know if 'rm' deletes directories recursively.
# iii. ACTION: Once inside, type '/recursive' to search for the flag. Press 'q' to exit.
man rm
