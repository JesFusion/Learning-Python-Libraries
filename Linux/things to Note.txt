    chmod (Change Mode):
    
    This command changes who can do what to a file. We have two ways to speak to the bouncer:
    
    1. Numeric (Octal):
    chmod (Change Mode) Permissions numbers:

    - Read (r) = 4
    - Write (w) = 2
    - Execute (x) = 1
    - No Permission = 0

    You sum these up for each of the three groups: User (Owner), Group, and Others.

    a. 755:

    User: 4+2+1 = 7 (Read + Write + Execute). You can do anything.

    Group: 4+0+1 = 5 (Read + Execute). Colleagues can run your script but not break it.

    Others: 4+0+1 = 5 (Read + Execute). The public can run it but not break it.
    
    ==> chmod 755 {filename}

    b. 600:

    User: 4+2 = 6 (Read + Write).

    Group/Others: 0. This is for SSH keys or secrets (.env files). No one else can even look at them.

    ==> chmod 600 {filename}




    2. Symbolic:
    - People:
    u = user
    g = group
    o = others

    - Abilities
    r = read
    w = write
    x = execute


    Examples:
    how to give only user permission to execute:
    ==> chmod u+x {filename}
    
    remove user's ability to execute:
    ==> chmod u-x {filename}

    give group ability to write:
    ==> chmod g+w {filename}

    revoke ability to read from others:
    ==> chmod o-r {filename}

    give everyone ability to read:
    ==> chmod +r {filename}
    
    give everyone ability to execute:
    ==> chmod +x {filename}

{
    chown (Change Ownership):
    
    chown jesfusion:devs file.yaml --> "jesfusion owns this yaml file, and it belongs to the 'devs' team."
