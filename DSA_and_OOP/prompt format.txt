DSA segment:
Segment 1.1: Introduction to DSA
●	What is a Data Structure? (The "container" for organizing and storing data)
●	What is an Algorithm? (The "recipe" or set of instructions to perform a task)
●	The Relationship: Choosing the right container (data structure) for your recipe (algorithm) to be efficient.
●	Why this matters: Scalability, efficiency, and your career (especially in ML).




OOP segment:
●	Segment 1.1: What is a Programming Paradigm?
○	Defining a "paradigm" (a way of thinking).
○	Introduction to Procedural Programming (the "list of instructions" approach).
○	The limitations of procedural programming at scale (global state, "spaghetti code," reusability challenges).
