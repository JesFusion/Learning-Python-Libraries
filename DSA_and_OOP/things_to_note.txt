    object = instance (meaning creating a new thing using existing parts. Like collecting LEGO bricks to create a toy)

    
    Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
    1. Maintainable: All the logic for a User is in ONE place.
    2. Reusable: We can create 10 million User objects from this

    3. Scalable: No more global variables or "spaghetti code."
