    The "Health Check" Endpoint is used by cloud platforms (AWS/K8s) to check if your app is alive.
    e.g:
    @app.get("/health")
    async def health_check():
        return "System Fully Operational!"
},

    To run your FastAPI script, navigate its directory and run:

    "uvicorn main:app --reload"

    - "--reload" means "Development Mode". 
    - If you change the code file, the server restarts automatically. 
    - NEVER use --reload in production[cite: 292].
