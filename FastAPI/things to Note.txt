    To run your FastAPI script, navigate its directory and run:

    "uvicorn main:app --reload"

    - "--reload" means "Development Mode". 
    - If you change the code file, the server restarts automatically. 
    - NEVER use --reload in production[cite: 292].

    Use Ctrl + C to turn off FastAPI server

    - 1xx (Informational Responses):
    These codes, like 100 Continue and 101 Switching Protocols, indicate the server has received the request and is continuing the process.


    - 2xx (Success Responses):
    These indicate the request was successfully handled. Examples include 200 OK, 201 Created, and 204 No Content.


    - 3xx (Redirection Messages):
    These codes, such as 301 Moved Permanently and 302 Found, require further action from the client to fulfill the request.


    - 4xx (Client Error Responses):
    These signify errors originating from the client, such as 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, and 404 Not Found.


    - 5xx (Server Error Responses):
    These codes, including 500 Internal Server Error and 503 Service Unavailable, point to issues on the server side preventing the fulfillment of a valid request.
