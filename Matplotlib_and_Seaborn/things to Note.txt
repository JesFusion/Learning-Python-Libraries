    Saving Figures (.savefig):

    - Raster (.png, .jpg): These are made of pixels. Think of it like taking a photo of your painting. If you zoom in too much, it gets blurry and pixelated. Use for Web pages, email and quick previews.

    - Vector (.svg, .pdf): These are math instructions. Instead of saving pixels, the file says "Draw a red line from point A to point B." You can zoom in infinitely, and the line will always be perfectly smooth. Use for Academic papers, posters, Adobe Illustrator editing, etc.
