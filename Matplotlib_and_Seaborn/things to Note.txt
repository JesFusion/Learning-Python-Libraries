    Saving Figures (.savefig):

    - Raster (.png, .jpg): These are made of pixels. Think of it like taking a photo of your painting. If you zoom in too much, it gets blurry and pixelated. Use for Web pages, email and quick previews.

    - Vector (.svg, .pdf): These are math instructions. Instead of saving pixels, the file says "Draw a red line from point A to point B." You can zoom in infinitely, and the line will always be perfectly smooth. Use for Academic papers, posters, Adobe Illustrator editing, etc.

    Types of Skew and their fixes:


    - Right Skew (Positive Skew): 
    
    The tail extends to the right (e.g., Jeff Bezos walking into a bar; the average income skyrockets, but the median stays low).

    The Fix: Log Transformation. It squeezes the long tail back toward the center.

    - Left Skew (Negative Skew):
    
    The tail extends to the left (e.g., age at death; most are old, a few are young).

    The Fix: Power Transformations (Square/Cube) or Box-Cox.

    To test for normality, we use stats.probplot(). Most important parameters are:


    i. x:
    
    An array-like object containing the sample or response data to be plotted.
    
    ii. dist:
    
    A string (e.g., 'norm', 't', 'expon') or a distribution instance. This specifies the theoretical distribution to compare against. The default is 'norm' (standard normal).    
    
    iii. plot:
    
    An optional object used for plotting (typically matplotlib.pyplot or a specific Axes object). If provided, it will generate the visual plot including the data quantiles and, if fit=True, the best-fit line.


    Other parameters are:

    iv. sparams:
    
    A tuple of distribution-specific shape, location, and scale parameters. These are passed to the theoretical distribution specified in the dist argument.
    
    
    v. rvalue:
    
    A boolean (default False). If set to True and a plot is provided with fit=True, the coefficient of determination (\(R^{2}\)) is included on the plot.

    vi. fit:
    
    A boolean (default True). If True, the function calculates a least-squares regression best-fit line for the data.

    We use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or Class Weights on Categorial datasets to fix class imbalance before training our Model
