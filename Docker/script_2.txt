# #!: The "Shebang". It tells the Linux kernel which interpreter to use (bash) to execute this file.

# ==========================================
# MODULE 1.1: THE ARCHITECTURE OF ISOLATION
# ==========================================
# This script demonstrates that Containers are NOT Virtual Machines.
# They share the Host Kernel. We will prove this by comparing
# the Host's Kernel version with the Container's Kernel version.

# ------------------------------------------
# 1. THE HOST KERNEL (Your Ubuntu Machine)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [HOST] Checking Host Kernel Version ---"

# 'uname -r' prints the release version of the kernel currently running in RAM.
# We store this in a variable to compare later.
# ANNOTATION:
# uname: "Unix Name". A system call to get system info.
# -r: The specific flag for "kernel release".
# $(): Command Substitution. It runs the command inside the parenthesis first,
#      captures the output, and assigns it to the variable HOST_KERNEL.
HOST_KERNEL=$(uname -r)

# ANNOTATION:
# $: When used before a variable name (like $HOST_KERNEL), it "expands" the variable,
#    meaning it replaces the variable name with its stored value.
echo "Host Kernel: $HOST_KERNEL"
echo "-------------------------------------------"

# ------------------------------------------
# 2. THE DOCKER ENGINE (Client vs Daemon)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [ENGINE] Checking Client/Server Architecture ---"
# Docker is split into two parts:
# 1. The Client (CLI): What this script is running.
# 2. The Server (Daemon): The background process (dockerd) managing the containers.
# 'docker version' shows both. If the Daemon is down, this command fails.
# ANNOTATION:
# | (Pipe): Takes the output (stdout) of the left command and feeds it as input (stdin) to the right command.
# grep: Global Regular Expression Print. Filters text.
# -E: Extended Regex. Allows us to use special characters like '|' for logical OR.
# "Client:|Server:|Version:": Matches lines containing "Client:" OR "Server:" OR "Version:".
docker version | grep -E "Client:|Server:|Version:"

# ------------------------------------------
# 3. THE REGISTRY & THE IMAGE
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [REGISTRY] Pulling the 'alpine' image ---"
# We use 'alpine' because it is tiny (5MB).
# If the image is not found locally, the Daemon contacts the Registry (Docker Hub)
# to download the layers.
# WHY ALPINE? It's the standard "minimal" Linux image for testing.
# ANNOTATION:
# pull: Downloads the image layers from the registry to your local cache.
# :latest: The "Tag". If you don't specify a tag, Docker assumes :latest.
docker pull alpine:latest

# ------------------------------------------
# 4. THE PROOF (Shared Kernel)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [PROOF] Running a Container to check ITS Kernel ---"
# docker run: Creates AND Starts a container.
# --rm: AUTOMATIC CLEANUP. This tells the Daemon: "As soon as this process exits, delete the container."
#       Without this, you leave "zombie" stopped containers eating up disk space.
# alpine: The image to use.
# uname -r: The command to run INSIDE the container.
# ANNOTATION:
# variable=$(...): Again, capturing the output of the docker command into a variable.
CONTAINER_KERNEL=$(docker run --rm alpine uname -r)

echo "Container Kernel: $CONTAINER_KERNEL"

# ------------------------------------------
# 5. CONCLUSION
# ------------------------------------------
echo "-------------------------------------------"

# ANNOTATION:
# if [ ... ]; then: The standard bash syntax for conditional logic.
# "..." : We quote the variables to prevent errors if they happen to be empty/null.
# == : The string comparison operator. Checks if the text on the left matches the text on the right.
if [ "$HOST_KERNEL" == "$CONTAINER_KERNEL" ]; then
    echo "MATCH CONFIRMED: The Container is using the Host's Kernel."
    echo "Proof that Docker is NOT a Virtual Machine."
else
    echo "MISMATCH: This should not happen on native Linux!"

# fi: "Finish If". Closes the conditional block.

















































































# ==========================================
# MODULE 1.2: CONTAINER ANATOMY & LIFECYCLE
# ==========================================
# We will manually manage the lifecycle of a "detached" container.
# We use a Python image to run a simple HTTP server.

CONTAINER_NAME="jesse-web-server"

# ------------------------------------------
# 1. CLEANUP (Idempotency)
# ------------------------------------------
# We check if a container with this name already exists to avoid conflicts.
# /dev/null 2>&1 silences errors if the container doesn't exist.
echo "--- [PRE-CHECK] Cleaning up old containers ---"

# ANNOTATION:
# rm -f: Force remove. Even if the container is running, this kills and deletes it.
# > /dev/null: Redirects Standard Output (stdout) to the "black hole" (discards it).
# 2>&1: Redirects Standard Error (stderr) to where Standard Output is going (the black hole).
#       This ensures the script stays silent even if the container doesn't exist yet.
docker rm -f $CONTAINER_NAME > /dev/null 2>&1

# ------------------------------------------
# 2. RUN (Create + Start) in DETACHED MODE
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [ACTION] Starting Python Web Server ---"
# -d (Detached): Run in the background. Returns the CLI control to us immediately.
#       Without -d, this script would freeze here waiting for the server to finish (which it never does).
# --name: Assigns a human-readable DNS name. If we don't do this, Docker assigns a random name like "boring_wozniak".
# -p 8080:8000: PORT MAPPING. Maps Host Port 8080 to Container Port 8000.
#       (Linux Networking: We are punching a hole in the bridge network).
# python:3.9-slim: The image. "slim" means it has Python but minimal extra junk (smaller size).
# python -m http.server 8000: The COMMAND (PID 1). This starts a web server inside the container.
# ANNOTATION:
# Port Mapping (-p host:container):
#       Traffic hits your Ubuntu IP on port 8080 -> Docker intercepts it -> forwards to container port 8000.
docker run -d --name $CONTAINER_NAME -p 8080:8000 python:3.9-slim python -m http.server 8000 # container inside a container that is actually a process

# ------------------------------------------
# 3. INSPECTION (PS & INSPECT)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [INSPECT] Listing Running Processes ---"
# docker ps: Shows only RUNNING containers.
# We grep for our name to filter the list.
docker ps | grep $CONTAINER_NAME

echo "--- [METADATA] Inspecting PID ---"
# docker inspect: Returns a giant JSON object with all config details.
# -f '{{...}}': Go-Template formatting. We extract specifically the Host Process ID (PID).
# WHY? This proves the container is just a normal Linux process on your Ubuntu machine.
# ANNOTATION:
# .State.Pid: Navigates the JSON structure to find the process ID.
# This variable assignment captures that PID so we can print it.
PID=$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' $CONTAINER_NAME)
echo "The Container is actually Linux Process ID: $PID"

# ------------------------------------------
# 4. LOGS (Standard Streams)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [LOGS] Triggering Traffic & Reading Logs ---"
# We use curl to send a request to localhost:8080.
# The container receives it on port 8000.
# The python server prints the access log to STDOUT.
# ANNOTATION:
# curl: Client URL. A command line tool to make web requests.
# -s: Silent mode. Don't show the progress bar.
curl -s "http://localhost:8080" > /dev/null

# docker logs: Reads the STDOUT/STDERR pipe of the container.
# This shows us what the python script printed.
# ANNOTATION:
# Since we ran in detached mode (-d), we can't see the output on our screen.
# 'docker logs' goes back and fetches everything the container has printed since it started.
docker logs $CONTAINER_NAME

# ------------------------------------------
# 5. SHUTDOWN (Stop vs Kill vs Prune)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [SHUTDOWN] Stopping the container ---"
# docker stop: Sends SIGTERM (Signal 15). Tells the app "Please finish up and close."
# If it doesn't close in 10s, Docker sends SIGKILL.
docker stop $CONTAINER_NAME

echo "--- [CLEANUP] Removing the container artifact ---"
# docker rm: Deletes the stopped container layer from disk.
# If we don't do this, 'docker ps -a' would show it as "Exited".
# ANNOTATION:
# A stopped container still takes up disk space (logs, writable layer). 'rm' frees that space.
docker rm $CONTAINER_NAME

echo "--- [GARBAGE COLLECTION] System Prune ---"
# docker system prune -f: The Nuclear Option.
# Deletes ALL stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images.
# WARNING: Extremely destructive. We use it here to ensure a clean slate.
# ANNOTATION:
# -f: Force. Don't ask for confirmation ("Are you sure?"). Just do it.
docker system prune -f

# MODULE 1.3: THE INTERACTIVE SHELL & EXEC
# ==========================================
# Demonstrates how to "hack" into a running container to debug it.
# This replaces the need for SSH.

CONTAINER_NAME="jesse-sleeper"

# 1. Start a "Dummy" Container
# We run 'sleep 300' just to keep the container alive so we can hack it.
echo "--- Starting a sleeper container ---"

# ANNOTATION:
# ubuntu:latest: A much larger image than Alpine, containing standard GNU tools.
# sleep 300: This is the critical part. A container only lives as long as its main process.
#            If we didn't run 'sleep', the Ubuntu container would start, see nothing to do, and exit immediately.
#            We are "buying time" (300 seconds) to mess around inside.
docker run -d --name $CONTAINER_NAME ubuntu:latest sleep 300

# ------------------------------------------
# 2. EXEC (The Hijack)
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [EXEC] Running a command INSIDE the container ---"
# docker exec: Runs a NEW command in an EXISTING container.
# It joins the existing Namespaces (Network, Mount, PID).
# This is NOT starting a new container; it's entering the current one.
# We run 'ls -la' to list files inside the container's root directory.

# ANNOTATION:
# exec: Short for "execute". It spawns a secondary process side-by-side with the main process (sleep).
# ls -la /var: We are asking the container to list the contents of its internal /var directory.
# This proves we are looking at the container's filesystem, not your host's filesystem.
docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME ls -la /var

# ------------------------------------------
# 3. INSTALLING TOOLS (The "Bad Practice")
# ------------------------------------------
echo "--- [DEBUGGING] Installing vim (Simulated) ---"
# In a disaster scenario, you might need to install tools to debug.
# NOTE: This is "Mutable Infrastructure". Changes here disappear if the container is deleted.
# We pass 'apt-get update' into the container.

# ANNOTATION:
# apt-get update: Refreshes the package lists inside the Ubuntu container.
# > /dev/null 2>&1: We've seen this before. It mutes the massive wall of text apt-get usually spits out.
# This shows that we can run complex administrative commands (like installing software) inside a live container.
docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME apt-get update > /dev/null 2>&1
echo "Package list updated inside container (PID: $CONTAINER_NAME)."

# ------------------------------------------
# 4. THE INTERACTIVE SHELL INSTRUCTION
# ------------------------------------------
# We cannot script an interactive shell session easily because it requires a user TTY.
# Instead, we generate the command for YOU to run.

# ANNOTATION:
# You cannot run 'docker exec -it' inside a non-interactive bash script because the script
# doesn't have a keyboard attached to it effectively.
# That is why the script pauses here to tell YOU to do it manually.

Module 1: The Metal - Lab 01

Student: Nwachukwu Jesse
Objective: Validate the Docker Installation and Dissect the Execution Flow.

Step 1: The "Hello World"

In your terminal, run the following command. This is the "smoke test" for your infrastructure.

docker run hello-world


Step 2: Forensic Analysis of Output

You should see text output in your terminal. Let's break down exactly what happened, line by line.

Line A: "Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally"

Concept: Image Caching.

What happened: The Daemon (dockerd) checked your local hard drive (specifically /var/lib/docker) for an image named hello-world.

Result: It wasn't there.

Why: This is a fresh install.

Line B: "latest: Pulling from library/hello-world"

Concept: The Tag.

Explanation: You didn't specify a version (e.g., hello-world:v1), so Docker assumed you meant latest. This is the default tag.

Line C: "c1ec31eb5944: Pull complete"

Concept: Layers.

Explanation: Docker images are not single files; they are stacks of layers (like a cake). This image is tiny, so it only has one layer with the ID ending in 5944.

Why this matters: If you download a huge image (like PyTorch) and later download a slightly different version, Docker will only download the new layers, saving you massive bandwidth.

Line D: "Digest: sha256:..."

Concept: Content Addressable Storage.

Explanation: This is the cryptographic signature of the image. It guarantees that the code you downloaded is exactly bit-for-bit what the developer published. No man-in-the-middle attacks.

Line E: "Hello from Docker!"

Concept: Standard Output (stdout).

Explanation: The container successfully started!

The Daemon created a new set of Namespaces (isolation).

It set up Cgroups (limits).

It executed the binary file inside the image.

That binary printed this text to stdout.

The Daemon streamed that text back to your Client.

The process finished, and the container Exited (stopped).

Step 3: Verify the Aftermath

Now that the container has run and stopped, where did it go?

Run this command to see running containers:

- docker ps

Result: It should be empty. Why? Because hello-world finished its job and shut down.

Now, run this command to see all containers (including dead ones):

- docker ps -a


Result: You should see one entry.

CONTAINER ID: A random hash (e.g., a1b2c3d4).

IMAGE: hello-world.

STATUS: Exited (0).

Step 4: The Cleanup (Garbage Collection)

We don't want dead containers cluttering your billionaire workstation.

Run this to clean up the specific container (replace [CONTAINER_ID] with the ID you saw above):

- docker rm [CONTAINER_ID]


Or, run the nuclear option to delete all stopped containers (Use with caution in production!):

- docker container prune

# SEGMENT 2: CONTAINER ANATOMY & LIFECYCLE LAB
# AUTHOR: Senior MLOps Engineer (Your Future Self)
# OS: Ubuntu 24.04
# GOAL: Master the state machine of Docker containers (Run -> Stop -> Kill -> Rm)
# ==============================================================================

# 1. CLEANUP (Pre-computation check)
# What: We forcibly remove any existing container named 'billionaire-model' to avoid name conflicts.
# Why: Docker container names must be unique. If we run this script twice, it would fail without this.
# What if: We omit this? The script crashes on line 20 saying "Conflict. The container name is in use."
docker rm -f billionaire-model 2>/dev/null || true

echo "--- 1. THE CREATION (docker run) ---"

# 2. RUNNING A DETACHED CONTAINER
# What: We start a container using the lightweight 'alpine' image and make it sleep for 1000 seconds.
# Parameters:
#   -d          : Detached Mode. Runs in background. Returns the Container ID immediately.
#                 (Why: In MLOps, training jobs take hours. We don't want our shell blocked.)
#   --name      : Assigns the human-readable name 'billionaire-model'.
#                 (Why: Referring to 'billionaire-model' is easier than 'a1b2c3d4e5'.)
#   alpine      : The image name. A 5MB Linux distro.
#                 (Why: We don't need a heavy Ubuntu image just to test lifecycle commands.)
#   sleep 1000  : The command the container runs (PID 1).
#                 (Why: If we don't give it a long-running process, the container exits immediately.)
docker run -d --name billionaire-model alpine sleep 1000

# 3. INSPECTION (docker ps)
echo -e "\n--- 2. VERIFICATION (docker ps) ---"
# What: List only the currently running containers.
# Why: To confirm our 'billionaire-model' is actually alive and didn't crash on startup.
docker ps

# 4. DEEP DIVE (docker inspect)
echo -e "\n--- 3. METADATA (docker inspect) ---"
# What: Extract the IP Address from the massive JSON metadata.
# Parameters:
#   -f '...' : Format flag using Go templates to parse the JSON.
# Why: 'docker inspect' dumps 500 lines of JSON. We usually only care about specific fields like IP or Volumes.
# What if: We run just 'docker inspect'? We get flooded with text.
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' billionaire-model

# 5. LOGGING (docker logs)
echo -e "\n--- 4. OBSERVABILITY (docker logs) ---"
# First, let's generate some logs inside the container artificially
# What: We use 'exec' to print to stdout inside the running container.
docker exec billionaire-model echo "Epoch 1: Loss 0.99"
docker exec billionaire-model echo "Epoch 2: Loss 0.45"

# Now we read them
# What: Fetch the STDOUT/STDERR history of the container.
# Why: This is how you debug model crashes. You don't SSH in; you read logs.
docker logs billionaire-model

# 6. STOPPING (Graceful Shutdown)
echo -e "\n--- 5. GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN (docker stop) ---"
# What: Sends SIGTERM to the process.
# Why: Allows the process to finish current tasks (e.g., saving a checkpoint) before closing.
# What if: We skip this? The process might corrupt data if killed instantly.
docker stop billionaire-model
# Verify it's gone from 'docker ps' (running) but present in 'docker ps -a' (all)
docker ps -a | grep billionaire-model

# 7. RESTARTING
echo -e "\n--- 6. RESURRECTION (docker start) ---"
# What: Restarts a stopped container.
# Why: It reuses the existing filesystem layer (data is preserved).
docker start billionaire-model

# 8. KILLING (The Nuclear Option)
echo -e "\n--- 7. ASSASSINATION (docker kill) ---"
# What: Sends SIGKILL.
# Why: The process is stuck/frozen and won't listen to SIGTERM.
# What if: You use this on a database? You might corrupt the database file.
docker kill billionaire-model

# 9. HOUSEKEEPING (docker system prune)
echo -e "\n--- 8. GARBAGE COLLECTION (docker rm & prune) ---"
# What: Remove the specific container metadata.
# Why: A stopped/killed container still occupies disk space (logs, writable layer).
docker rm billionaire-model

# What: The command below is commented out because it is DESTRUCTIVE.
# Command: docker system prune -f
# Why: It deletes ALL stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images.
# What if: You run this on a production server? You might accidentally delete a stopped container you intended to debug later.
echo "Run 'docker system prune' manually if you want to clean up unused space."

echo -e "\nSegment 2 Lab Complete."

# We type: docker run -e USER_NAME="Jesse" jesse-runtime:v1
# Docker sees:
#   1. ENTRYPOINT: "python greeter.py"
#   2. CMD (from Dockerfile): "DefaultMode" (We didn't change this part)
#   3. -e FLAG: USER_NAME="Jesse" (This OVERRIDES the Dockerfile ENV)
#
# Final Execution inside Linux:
#   USER_NAME="Jesse" python greeter.py DefaultMode
#
# Python sees:
#   os.environ['USER_NAME'] -> "Jesse" (The new sticky note)
#   sys.argv[1] -> "DefaultMode" (The default argument)
docker run --rm -e USER_NAME="Jesse" $IMAGE_NAME

# Cleanup: go back to the previous folder
